### project structure
    This project did't have a harder structure it have only 5 structure fist is class person second is class customer third is class driver fourth is class deliveryorder and the last one is main method to run the oop and to show the output that we want if u want to change some name or some item u can change that it to main method 
    
# This project have a lot of thing to improve
    firstly this project is not complete we need to change in the class Customer to add put a address and in the place_order i didn't return the item

    i found that it would be better if i use the getter and setter to lock the access to Person name class
